                    Panchgani was developed by the British during the British Raj as a summer resort under the
                    supervision of Lord John Chesson in the 1860s. Panchgani was developed as a retirement place because
                    its climate remained pleasant throughout the year. He surveyed the hills of this region with
                    Rustomji Dubash and finally decided on this nameless area around the five villages: Dandeghar,
                    Godavali, Ambral, Khingar, and Taighat. The place was aptly named Panchgani, meaning "land between
                    five villages", and Chesson was made superintendent..
